		<h1>Love on Valentine's Day</h1>
		<p class="description"> Valentine's day has come to an end. I surveyed a number of people with the question of "Are you taken, single, or in a no label relationship?". </br> These were the results of the survey:
        </p>
		<div class="numbers">
			<div class="survey">
				<h3 id="tn">Taken</h3>
				<p id="number1"></p>
			</div>
			<div class="survey">
				<h3 id="sg">Single</h3>
				<p id="number2"></p>
			</div>
			<div class="survey">
				<h3 id="nl">No Label Relationship</h3>
				<p id="number3"></p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="wow">The majority of the results were <span id="results"></span>.</p>
		<p class="wow">The most common starting letter of a first name of people I asked was <span id="ltr"></span> .</p>
